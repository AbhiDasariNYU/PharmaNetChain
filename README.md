Architecture Blueprint

This description outlines the architecture of the solution that has been developed as part of the Capstone project. The solution is focused on a supply chain network, and involves the following stakeholders:

Manufacturers: These are the drug manufacturers that are registered, or will be registered in the future, with the network.
Distributors: These are the drug distributors that are registered, or will be registered in the future, on the network. They purchase drugs directly from the manufacturers.
Retailers: These are pharmacists or drug retailers that receive drug consignments from the distributors.
Consumers: These are the people who purchase medicines from pharmacists.
Transporters: These are entities that are responsible for the shipment of consignments from one point to another.
The workflow for the supply chain network is divided into four units:

Company Registration: All entities that wish to be part of the supply chain network must be registered or stored on the ledger.
Drug Registration: Any drug manufactured has to be registered on the ledger by the manufacturing company.
Transfer Drug: A buyer of the product will raise a Purchase Order for a particular drug. Based on the Purchase Order, the seller of the drug will initiate the process of shipment of the drug with the help of a transporter company, and a shipment object will be created. Once the consignment is received by the buyer, the buyer will become the new owner of each item of the batch.
View Lifecycle: This is the process to view the lifecycle of the asset to date. Participants in the network can use the smart contract's "View Lifecycle"
functionality to view the entire lifecycle of a specific drug.
